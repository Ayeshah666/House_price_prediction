        "\n",
        "#### **Objective**  \n",
        "The goal of this project is to **build a regression model from scratch** to predict house prices using the **Boston Housing Dataset**. Three different models—**Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**—were implemented and evaluated to compare their performance.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**  \n",
        "- **Dataset Cleaning:** Removed unnecessary columns (`CHAS`, `ZN`) and handled missing values.  \n",
        "- **Feature Engineering:** Standardized numerical features for better model performance.  \n",
        "- **Outlier Handling:** Detected and removed outliers to improve prediction accuracy.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2️⃣ Model Implementation (From Scratch)**  \n",
        "✅ **Linear Regression:** Implemented using gradient descent without using built-in libraries.  \n",
        "✅ **Random Forest:** Built a custom decision tree-based model for ensemble learning.  \n",
        "✅ **XGBoost:** Created an optimized boosting algorithm for better prediction accuracy.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3️⃣ Performance Evaluation**  \n",
        "- Models were compared using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and **R² Score**.  \n",
        "- Performance metrics were calculated to determine the best regression model.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **4️⃣ Feature Importance Visualization**  \n",
        "- For tree-based models (**Random Forest & XGBoost**), feature importance was plotted to understand which features impact house prices the most.  \n",
        "- The visualization helps in interpreting the model results and understanding key predictors.  \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Results & Conclusion**  \n",
        "- **XGBoost performed the best** in terms of accuracy and error minimization.  \n",
        "- **Feature importance analysis** showed that factors like crime rate, average number of rooms, and property tax rates significantly influenced house prices.  \n",
        "- This project successfully demonstrated the implementation of regression models **without using pre-built libraries**, making it a strong learning experience in machine learning fundamentals.  \n",
